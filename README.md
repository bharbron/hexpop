# hexpop

Python scripts for the pre-alpha, weekend project version of HexPop! Basically enough here to manually create the notebook for my current campaign. No UI, no documentation, not very flexible, but theoretically someone could edit the json file of tables and create a notebook for their own campaign.

Going to be fully superseded by the HexPop! js/react/redux/electron application I'm working on
